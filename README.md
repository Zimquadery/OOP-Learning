# OOP Learning
This repository contains lab practice files from the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during my undergraduate program. The exercises here demonstrate my understanding of key OOP concepts through practical examples.

## Repository Contents
- **Encapsulation**: Each exercise showcases how to bundle data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, such as a class in C++. This helps in protecting the data from unauthorized access and misuse.

- **Inheritance**: Some files illustrate the concept of inheritance, where new classes are derived from existing classes. This demonstrates code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

- **Polymorphism**: The exercises include examples of polymorphism, where methods can perform different tasks based on the object that is invoking them. This is demonstrated through function overloading and overriding.

- **Abstraction**: The labs also cover abstraction, which involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This is done through the creation of abstract classes and interfaces.
